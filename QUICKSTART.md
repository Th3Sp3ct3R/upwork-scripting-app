## What to Customize

### 1. Your Profile (in `config.py`)

Edit the proposal system prompt to match YOUR background:

```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are writing Upwork proposals for a skilled developer named [YOUR NAME].
Their background:
- [YOUR EXPERIENCE]
- [YOUR SKILLS]
...
"""
```

### 2. Job Filters (in `config.py`)

Adjust budget minimums and keywords to match what you want:

```python
BUDGET_FILTERS = {
    "fixed_min": 150,    # Change this
    "hourly_min": 25,    # Or this
}

KEYWORD_WHITELIST = [
    "automation",        # Add your target keywords
    "python",
]
```

### 3. RSS Feeds (in `config.py`)

Change which Upwork categories you monitor:

```python
UPWORK_FEEDS = [
    "https://www.upwork.com/ab/feed/jobs/rss?q=landing+page&sort=recency",
    # Add more feeds...
]
```

## Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'anthropic'"**
→ Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**"CLAUDE_API_KEY not set"**
→ Check `.env` has your API key

**"Database locked"**
→ Only one backend can run at a time

**Dashboard doesn't load**
→ Ensure backend is running on `:8000`
→ Check browser console (F12) for errors

---

## Next Steps

1. **Customize** job filters for your niche
2. **Test** 1-2 cycles and review proposal quality
3. **Adjust** Claude prompt if tone doesn't match you
4. **Monitor** proposals daily — review queue in dashboard
5. **Track** which proposals get responses
6. **Optimize** based on what works
